Stop using inheritance if possible.

OO developers use inheritance for two reasons: they don't like typing, or they like types.

1. Don't like typing (use inheritance to share code):
It creates coupling.

2. Types:
Adds complexity as inheritance grows.
You cannot model your domain accurately.

The alternatives:
1. Use interface (java) without polymorphism, so no coupling.

2. Delegation, delegate the functionality to other object, will expose none of the base APIs.
  Has-A trumps Is-A

3. Using mixins to share functionality (sisyphus mixins). Mixins are a set of functions that can be shared by other projects.
