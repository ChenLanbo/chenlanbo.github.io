Temporal coupling happens when your code imposes a sequence on the things that is not required to solve the problem.

We should think about the role of time as a design element of the software itself.
Two aspect:
1. Concurrency: the software mechanism that executes two or more pieces of code to act as if they run at the same time.
2. Ordering: the relative positions of things in time.

Use activity diagram, which helps:
1. to find out what can happen at the same time.
2. what must happen in a strict order.

Find activities that takes time, but not time in your code, which means i/o operations, RPCs, etc.
