Actor is an independent virtual processor with its own local private state.

Each actor has a mailbox. Message passing is one-way and no reply.

Actors run concurrently, asynchronously and share nothing.

We should use the actor model:
1. reduce the lock contention.
2. simplify the code.
3. avoid possible deadlock.
